## 👋 Hi, I'm Kiri

### 🔬 From Pipettes to Python
I started out with a PhD in Pharmacy & Biomedical Sciences and somehow — entirely unintentionally — ended up a full-stack developer. It turns out that solving problems, asking questions, and building cool things crosses disciplines pretty easily.

What started as “learn just enough Python to get by” spiraled into:
- Rebooting long-lost HTML & CSS skills
- Learning JavaScript and AJAX (wait, that still exists?)
- Falling completely in love with Flask
- Accidentally automating a popular Python plotting library for fun
- Discovering I really like building things that make other people’s lives easier

### 🎨 Current Project: Python With Training Wheels
A playful tool that turns CSVs + dropdown menus into beautiful plots through Matplotlib and Seaborn — and gives you the Python code too.

It does:
- Let you explore data visually, without writing a line of code
- Generate clean, readable Python you can copy to Colab or VS Code
- Make you feel like a plotting wizard (cape not included)

It doesn’t:
- Save your data permanently (refresh = poof ✨)
- Expect you to remember what sns.set_theme() does
- Judge your CSV filenames

### 🤹‍♀️ Skills
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Flask
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- Science-driven problem solving
